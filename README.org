# ezeka: Eclectic Zettelkasten

## Format of the File Names

1. If the Zettel is in the `numerus currens` Kasten,
   the file name should

## Format of Zettel Files [*r-8526*]{.spurious-link target="r-8526"}

The file begins with a header encoding metadata
using a very simplified version of [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
 The structure I am using is as follows:

1.  The first line of the header contains the rubric line condensing
    various key pieces of information ab the note
    [*f-5889*]{.spurious-link target="f-5889"}.

    The rubric consists of optional marker (ยง) that signifies that the
    caption (shortened titled in the file name [*g-2502*]{.spurious-link
    target="g-2502"}) and title are stable and differences should be
    ignored. What follows is the the note ID, category enclosed in
    squiggly brackets { }, caption (which should match the file name
    caption), and an optional citation key preceded by @ (or & for
    primary sources). For example:

    ``` example
    rubric: ยงr-8526 {Zettel} using metadata block in notes
    ```

2.  The rest of the metadata follows:

    Each line consists of key (scalar) and value (scalar or flow
    sequence). Currently recognized keys are:

    - `title`{.verbatim} (human-formatted title used when inserting
        links)
    - `created`{.verbatim} (ISO8601 8601 date/time),
    - `modified`{.verbatim} (ISO8601 8601 date/time),
    - `parent`{.verbatim} (Zettel link),
    - `firstborn`{.verbatim} (Zettel link),
    - `oldnames`{.verbatim} (flow sequence of Zettel links),
    - `readings`{.verbatim} (flow sequence of ISO8601 dates), and
    - `keywords`{.verbatim} (flow sequence of #-prefixed words)
